					<h2>1. Money&Sense Missions</h2>
						<h3>Advisory Mission in Ethic Investments </h3>
							<p>
								We currently live in a world where financial systems are really important and relate to almost every individuals and organization. Money is in the center of every organized human action. Thus, saving money is  necessary to plan the future for individuals as for organization. 
								Association without lucrative goal are a particular kind of organization since they do not focus on profits but on general interests. Nevertheless, they need money to sustain. Unfortunately, saving money at the bank might sometimes lead their savings to finance projects that are in contradiction with the association's mission of general interests. That is why we created "Money&Sense". Our consultancy team work with associations to establish a strategy to invest safely their money in projects that are in line with their own mission. We want to offer associations without lucrative goal the possibility to be fully consistent with their overall missions, even in the way they manage their money.
							</p>
							<h4>Illlustration</h4>
								<p>
									For example, we could help an environmental association to find innovative green projects in which to invest their savings. We try to ensure the maximal level of safety and returns (even if priority is given to the ethic of investments) in our investments advice.
								</p>

						<h3>Advisory Mission in Financing Activities</h3>
							<p>
								We also intervene as consultants in order to help associations establishing a financing strategy and advise them on the activities they can implement to finance themselves: how to find sponsors/benefactors or donators, what kind of activities to raise funds, etc...
							</p>
